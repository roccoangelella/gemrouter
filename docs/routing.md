# Routing and quota

## Key pool

Configure one or more Gemini API keys via:

```env
GEMROUTER_GEMINI_API_KEYS=AIza...key1,AIza...key2
# or
GEMROUTER_GEMINI_API_KEYS_JSON=[{"id":"k1","key":"AIza...","quotaGroup":"proj-a","tier":"free","priority":100,"enabled":true}]
```

For richer per-account metadata (tiers, limit overrides) use `data/gemini-api-accounts.json`. The file matches keys by `id` to accounts by `id`. See `docs/gemini-api-accounts.example.json`.

## Per-app account isolation

Client apps can be restricted to a subset of configured Gemini account IDs. In **Apps and API Keys**,
enter the account IDs in the app's **Gemini account IDs** field (comma-separated). The router validates
the IDs when saving the app. Once assigned, every Gemini attempt for that app—including same-model
retries, local backpressure waits, and model fallback—uses only that subset. An empty field preserves
the legacy shared key pool.

This setting is server-side: clients still use the normal OpenAI-compatible base URL and their own
client API key. Do not give a client admin access; the app key is the intended tenant boundary.

## Self-service users

The administrator can create a user from **Admin → Users** with a username and password. Each user
can then sign in at `/admin`, add or remove only their own Gemini API keys, and rotate their own
OpenAI-compatible client key. A user-owned client key is dynamically restricted to Gemini accounts
owned by that user, so an empty personal pool fails closed rather than using an administrator or
another user's account. The administrator can see each username and its connected-key count, and
deleting a user revokes their client key and removes their owned Gemini keys.

## Quota tracking

GemRouter tracks quota entirely in-process in `data/gemini-api-quota-ledger.json` - no Google Cloud calls, no `gcloud` CLI, no service account required. Tracked per quota group + model:

- **RPM** - requests in the last 60 s sliding window
- **TPM** - tokens in the last 60 s sliding window  
- **RPD** - requests since midnight **America/Los_Angeles** (matches Google's actual reset boundary, including DST changes)

On every response the ledger records real token counts (from the API reply) and upstream rate-limit headers (`x-ratelimit-remaining-requests-day`, etc.) as secondary validation. On a 429 the relevant events are optionally rolled back (`GEMROUTER_GEMINI_API_COUNT_FAILED_429_AS_USAGE`).

### Key selection

The pool picks the key/group with the best multi-factor score, evaluated in this order:

1. **Priority** - higher `priority` field wins
2. **Rotation** - least recently used key wins (round-robin at equal priority)
3. **Capacity score** - `rpmRatio×30 + tpmRatio×30 + rpdRatio×30` where each ratio is `remaining / limit`
4. **Config order** - tie-break by position in the key list

Keys at or beyond any limit (RPM, TPM, or RPD) are excluded from selection before scoring.

## Per-account tiers

Mixing free-tier (RPM 5, RPD 20) and Tier 1 (RPM 1000+, RPD 10 000+) accounts without limit overrides would make scoring unfair - the Tier 1 key would always win. Fix with per-model limit overrides in `data/gemini-api-accounts.json`:

```json
{
  "id": "account-tier1",
  "quotaGroup": "my-tier1-project",
  "tier": "tier1",
  "limits": {
    "gemini-2.5-flash": { "rpm": 1000, "tpm": 1000000, "rpd": 10000 },
    "gemini-3-flash-preview": { "rpm": 1000, "tpm": 2000000, "rpd": 10000 }
  }
}
```

Or via environment variable:

```env
GEMROUTER_GEMINI_API_GROUP_LIMITS_JSON={"my-tier1-project":{"gemini-2.5-flash":{"rpm":1000,"tpm":1000000,"rpd":10000}}}
```

## Backend routing

When `backendPreference=auto` (default), the backend sequence is resolved by model name:

- **gemini-\* / gemma-\*** → `gemini-api` first, then other backends if fallback is allowed
- **everything else** → `ollama` first, then other backends

Force a specific backend per request with the `x-gemrouter-backend` header (`gemini-api`, `gemini`, `ai-studio`, or `auto`). The alias `x-baribi-backend` is also accepted.

### Strict model IDs

Models listed in `strictModelIds` (config) never fall back to another backend, even on error. Use this to prevent Gemma models from silently falling back to a Flash endpoint.

## Fallback behavior

When `backendPreference=auto`, GemRouter falls back to the next backend on:

- 429 rate limit / quota exhaustion
- 401 / 403 auth failure
- model unavailable
- upstream timeout or transport error

Caller-error 4xx (bad request, invalid parameters) do not fall back.

The fallback chain is annotated in the response as `fallbackFrom` / `fallbackReason`.

## Cooldown

A failed attempt holds the model+account out for a window determined by the cooldown source:

| Source | Trigger | Duration |
|---|---|---|
| `retry-after` | 429 with `Retry-After` header | Exact header value |
| `pacific-reset` | 429 with `rateLimitScope=day` | Until next Pacific midnight (marks `dailyDepleted`) |
| `429-backoff` | generic 429 (no header/scope) | Escalating ladder (see below) |
| `daily-depleted` | 3rd generic 429 strike | Until next Pacific midnight |
| `high-demand` | 503 "overloaded/unavailable" | 30 s skip (model-wide; does not retry other accounts) |

### 429 escalation ladder

Generic 429s with no `Retry-After` and no day scope escalate **per model+account**, with
strikes accruing within a Pacific day and resetting at the midnight rollover:

1. **strike 1** → 1 min cooldown
2. **strike 2** → 5 min cooldown
3. **strike 3** → treated as daily quota depletion, parked until the next Pacific reset

A successful call clears the strike count and lifts any `429-backoff`/`daily-depleted`
cooldown for that model+account.

### High demand (503)

A 503 "high demand" is a Google-side capacity condition shared by all accounts, so the
router does **not** sweep the other keys - it records one attempt, applies a 30 s cooldown,
and moves straight to the next model in the chain.

Cooldowns can be cleared from the admin UI or via:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:4024/admin/provider/gemini-api/clear-cooldown \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GEMROUTER_ADMIN_TOKEN"
```

## Quota exposed to the dashboard

The guest dashboard at `/dashboard/summary` receives a compact quota snapshot:

```json
{
  "provider": {
    "quota": {
      "apiKeys": [...],
      "quotaGroups": [
        {
          "id": "my-project",
          "models": [
            {
              "model": "gemini-2.5-flash",
              "rpm": { "used": 2, "limit": 5, "remaining": 3 },
              "tpm": { "used": 4200, "limit": 250000, "remaining": 245800 },
              "rpd": { "used": 8, "limit": 20, "remaining": 12 }
            }
          ]
        }
      ],
      "rpdResetAt": "2026-06-26T07:00:00.000Z",
      "rpdWindow": "America/Los_Angeles"
    }
  }
}
```

The **cumulative remaining RPD** for a model across all accounts is the sum of `rpd.remaining` across every quota group. This is computed client-side by the frontend from the per-group data above. All values come directly from the local ledger - no Cloud Monitoring, no Google API calls.

## Local Ollama (vision + embeddings)

When `GEMROUTER_OLLAMA_LOCAL_ENABLED=true`, two models are served directly by the local
Ollama server, on explicit request only, with **no fallback**:

- **Embeddings** - `POST /v1/embeddings` (and `/embeddings`) for the configured embedding
  model returns an OpenAI-style vector list via Ollama `/api/embed`.
- **Vision** - dedicated `POST /v1/vision` (and `/vision`) endpoint. It always serves the
  configured vision model via Ollama `/api/chat`; image parts (`image_url`/`input_image`,
  data URIs or bare base64) are forwarded. On error it returns 502 and never falls back to
  Gemini.

Both require a valid app key but are intentionally kept **outside** the chat rate-limit /
concurrency / priority queue, so vision and embedding run as their own flows. Per-model
daily request counters persist to `data/ollama-local-usage.json` (Pacific reset) and
surface in the dashboard's "Ollama Local RPD" box.

## Admin management endpoints

All require the admin bearer token or session.

| Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|
| `GET/POST /admin/provider/gemini-api/accounts` | List accounts; `add`/`update`/`remove`/`list-models` subpaths manage the key pool live (persist to `accounts.json`, hot reload) |
| `GET/POST /admin/provider/models-config` | Read/set the routed model set and order (applied live, persisted to `model-config.json`) |
| `GET/POST /admin/provider/proxy` | Read/set the outbound proxy config |
| `POST /admin/apps` | Create an app; accepts an optional custom `apiKey` (e.g. `goon_` prefix) |

## Observability endpoints

| Endpoint | Auth | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /health` | none | Runtime health and compact quota summary |
| `GET /dashboard/summary` | none | Guest-safe stats, quota view, and local Ollama RPD |
| `GET /admin/summary` | admin | Full diagnostics, model catalog, apps |
| `GET /v1/provider/runtime` | client | Backend order and current key selection state |
| `GET /v1/provider/models` | client | Discovered model list |
| `GET /v1/provider/quota` | client | Per-key, per-model quota snapshot |
